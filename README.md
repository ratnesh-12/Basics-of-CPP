# Experiment-1

Aim: Create a Hello World and Calculator program

C++ Prgram Structure: 
•	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.
•	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.
•	The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.
•	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.
•	The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.
•	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.

Algorithm for Hello World Program:
💡 Steps:
Start
Include the necessary header file
Use main() function
Print "Hello, World!" using cout
End

Algorithm for Calculator Program:
💡 Steps:
Start
Input two numbers
Ask the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
Use a switch-case to perform the selected operation
Display the result
End
