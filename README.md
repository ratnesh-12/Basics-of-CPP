# Experiment-1

Aim: Create a Hello World and Calculator program

C++ Prgram Structure:  
•	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.  
•	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.  
•	The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.  
•	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.  
•	The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.  
•	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.  

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming. It is widely used for system/application software, game development, and competitive programming.

1. Hello World Program:<br>
The "Hello World" program is the most basic and introductory program in any programming language. In C++, it is used to demonstrate the structure of a simple program and how output is handled using the cout statement. This program includes the standard header file <iostream> for input-output operations and uses the main() function, which is the starting point of every C++ program. The cout object, along with the insertion operator <<, is used to print the message to the console.<br>
This program helps beginners understand:<br>
The syntax of C++<br>
Use of libraries<br>
Output statements<br>
Program execution flow<br>

2. Calculator Program:<br>
A basic calculator program is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In C++, this is done using standard operators and control structures like switch-case or if-else statements. The user is prompted to input two numbers and choose an operator. Based on the operator, the appropriate operation is performed, and the result is displayed using cout.<br>
This program helps in understanding:<br>
User input using cin<br>
Data types and variable declaration<br>
Arithmetic operators<br>
Decision-making structures (switch-case)<br>
Console output using cout<br>


Algorithm for Hello World Program:  
Start  
Include the necessary header file  
Use main() function  
Print "Hello, World!" using cout  
End  


Algorithm for Calculator Program:  
Start  
Input two numbers  
Ask the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /)  
Use a switch-case to perform the selected operation  
Display the result  
End
