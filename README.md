# Experiment-1

# Aim: Create a Hello World and Calculator program

#Tools used: Programiz online compiler

# Theory:<br>
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming. It is widely used for system/application software, game development, and competitive programming.<br>

# 1. Hello World Program:<br>
The "Hello World" program is the most basic and introductory program in any programming language. In C++, it is used to demonstrate the structure of a simple program and how output is handled using the cout statement. This program includes the standard header file <iostream> for input-output operations and uses the main() function, which is the starting point of every C++ program. The cout object, along with the insertion operator <<, is used to print the message to the console.<br>

# 2. Calculator Program:<br>
A basic calculator program is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In C++, this is done using standard operators and control structures like switch-case or if-else statements. The user is prompted to input two numbers and choose an operator. Based on the operator, the appropriate operation is performed, and the result is displayed using cout.<br>

# Algorithm for Hello World Program:  

Start  
Include the necessary header file  
Use main() function  
Print "Hello, World!" using cout  
End  


# Algorithm for Calculator Program:  

Start  
Input two numbers  
Ask the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /)  
Use a switch-case to perform the selected operation  
Display the result  
End  

#Conclusion: The Hello World and Calculator Program introduce C++ basicsâ€”output display, user input, and simple operations to build the foundation for further programming concepts.
